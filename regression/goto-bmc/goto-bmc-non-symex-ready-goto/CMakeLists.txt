# Second suite of tests is running `goto-cc` to produce "normal" goto-binaries,

# non-gracefully, with invariant violations. This behaviour is important enough
# that we want to test for it, but we expect the software to become better behaved
# in the future (by checking that the input binary *is* in symex-ready-goto form
# and if not produce appropriate error reporting for the user).
